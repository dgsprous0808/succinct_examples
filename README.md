# succinct_examples
Pythonic based examples for DB connections, pandas/scikit-learn ..., pyspark operations including MLLIB, TensorFlow

    It may be observed, in a general way,
      that life would be better, distinctly
    If more of the people with nothing to say
      were able to say it succinctly

# Purpose:
This is a cook-book of operations in small jupyter notebooks.  Notebook names are specific for the operation being highlighted.  These are unrealistically simplified.  Idea is to provide cut, paste and adapt examples of simple operations.    

## ConnectionsExamples
Connecting Python and PySpark to Oracle, Snowflake and AWS S3.

## PySpark_DataFrames
Barebones examples of PySpark DF examples.

## PySpark_MLLIB
MLLIB kmeans, linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree.

## TensorFlow
A classifier and DNNRegressor.
