# succinct_examples
Pythonic based examples for DB connections, pandas/scikit-learn ..., pyspark operations including MLLIB, TensorFlow

    It may be observed, in a general way,
      that life would be better, distinctly
    If more of the people with nothing to say
      were able to say it succinctly

# Purpose:
This is a cook-book of operations in small jupyter notebooks.  Notebook names are noteably unimaginative and specific for the operation being highlighted.
